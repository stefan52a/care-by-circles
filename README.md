## Status ##
This work is Work in Progress, implemented is the blockchain part:
- Users creating a genesis Circle
- Users accepting other members in their Circle (to a maximum of 150, Dunbar's number)
- Storage of hashed data and Circle identification
- Consensus in the form of a contract

Foreseen, but not implemented is:
- Asking for help
- Expelling a member of a Circle by majority (script has been written though: see below Transactions)
- The concept is blocklchain agnostic, its implementation, can be made in RGB, Rootstock and even in Ethereum, but for the moment we will use a BTC fork (see the powerpoint for further reasoning) (we also considered counterparty or Elements, but scripts are not easily programmable in a client)
- When we will fork the BTC blockchain. current BTC holders will already have some Circle tokens, 
- Related to that: we need to think about replay protection
- Some tokens are 'freed' to be spent, such as alreday implemented: the miner fee. They are not locked by the Oracle. The Oracle guards, via the agreed contract, the other remaining tokens.
- Unique identification of a person, for now this always returns true, see below

## Inspiration ##
- Formalizing and Securing Relationships on Public Networks by Nick Szab√≥
- Dunbar's number
- https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contract#Example_4:_Using_external_state by Mike Hearn
- The Social Dilemma by Netflix
- and the literature mentioned at the bottom of this readme.

## Summary ##
Alice's coins will be locked with a Special script. Alice can only spend to that special script, transactions that are cosigned by the Oracle server and Alice. The spending (to let Bob join the Circle) is only cosigned by the Oracle when 1 of the following is satisfied (the contract):

- (to let 'Bob' join Alice's Circle) The Oracle decides whether Alice's publickey belongs to a CircleInstance that a.o. stays under 150 (Dunbar's number) members. Then Alice gets some 'free" tokens and the remainder gets locked by a similarly Special script.

- (to expel a member) The Oracle decides whether a majority (which is greater than half of all Circle members + 1) of publickeys belonging to a CircleInstance exists, that asks to spend the tokens locked with the Special script. If it is a majority: the Oracle cosigns the spending of the tokens towards the pubkeys of that majority.  

Members agreeing in the Circle blockchain have consensus about the following:

- It follows the same rules as the Bitcoin blockchain, as of this writing
- When you join the system you get awarded ('airdropped') 1/100 Circle token, but only once. (unless you somehow change your id ;)
- This users' airdrop gets halved every 500k users entering the system.
- Alice (a user) should be able to invite other members (e.g. Bob & Charlie), they get some Oracle-locked tokens from Alice. Bob then gets half of Alice's tokens minus a miner fee.
- Not more than 150 people (Dunbar's number) may take part in 1 Circle
- Blockchain nodes cannot measure arbitrary conditions, so we must rely on an Oracle. An oracle is a server that has a keypair, and (co)signs transactions on request when a user-provided expression (contract) evaluates to true.
- A transaction is adding another person to one of your Circles

The Circle token is a fungible token, and is associated with identity. initially 1/100th (=1 million Satoshi) Circle token is associated with a telephone nr. (FTM to represent identity), but also less (e.g. 600) Satoshi token could be associated with an id.

Important is to consider that it will not be a simple single sign signature unlock script, but a multisig (either of Alice and the Oracle, where Alice invites Bob to join a Circle) or (Alice, Bob and Carol and the Oracle in a Circle of 5 (so they are a majority, and then can "expel" David)

The Circle blockchain is a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain.

## The Oracle server ##
This is an Express RESTful API server for the Oracle for Care By Circles, social inclusion.

An Oracle is any service that tries to execute a contract, a contract on which the users of this blockchain have consensus on.
This 150-rule contract is not an Oracle in a tighter definition, as it is not an external *event* that controls the flow of a smart contract. Consensus rule could be a better word. Although you could call somebody changing the 150 rule an event, that the Care By Circles consensus decides not to accept for executing functions, and in that way conrols the flow. Changing the 150-rule is actually a fork.

Circles are tribes with a maximum of 150 (Dunbar's number) people each.

Next to that the Oracle currently also checks whether an Id is really 1 unique human.
An individual person's id is not stored as is on the blockchain or decentral storage.

## GDPR consideration ##
In order, however, to determine the uniqueness of an id, the Oracle needs to have knowledge about that id. Therefore the Oracle gets the id along with a salt of the owner (user) and the Oracle stores the hash (fingerprint) in a table and forgets about the id and salt.
The oracle enforces the uniqueness of the id. The user may withdraw the salt and the Oracle promises only to remember the hash of id and that salt. If the user withdraws his salt, the data on his Circles in the blockchain is not retrievable anymore.
What gets stored in a decentral table, is:

1 to 1 relationship between:
"circle instance"  and  "Hash(id, salt)"

For the id it would be better to use some kind of DID system here (e.g. one using built-up reputation of a public key), but this is outside the scope at the moment.

Under the hood it uses Bitcoin blockchain principles for consensus (on Dunbar's number) and Oracle contracts with Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT).

The Oracle needs to be trusted by people using it.

## Transactions ##
Transactions are locked by the following scriptPub (to lock output):

```
IF
<contractPleaseSign_hash> DROP
2 <ID pubkey> <oraclePleaseSignTx_pubkey> 2
ELSE
<contractBurn_hash> DROP
n+1 <IDi pubkey> ..... <IDm pubkey><oracleBurn pubkey> m+1
ENDIF
CHECKMULTISIG
```
where n>m/2, and contractPleaseSign_hash is the hash of the contract, simplified:

```
const ID = require('./identification');
module.exports.contract = (newId, callback) => {
    const dunbarsNumber = 150; 
    ID.checkExists(newId, (err) => {
        if (err) callback('', err + ' Contract error: Not allowed (newId does not exist)');
        ID.hasGenesisCircle(newId, (err, circleId) => {
            if (err) callback('', err + ' Contract error:  Not allowed (NewId already in Circleinstance) ' + circleId);
            else if (CircleId.nrOfMembers >= dunbarsNumber) callback('', err + ' Contract error: Not allowed (Circleinstance has reached the limit of ' + dunbarsNumber + ' unique Ids) ' + circleId);
            else callback(PSBT);
        });
    });
}
```

PSBT transaction which is partially to be signed by the Oracle oraclePleaseSignTx, looks like:

In context it looks like:

Because Circle tokens are fungible and airdropped Circle tokens are "earned" when creating your first Circle instance, the Circle tokens can also be used to include new members in a Circle you are part of buit is started by another user.

## Usage ##
1. Setup a BTC regtest server with junderw who maintains an image of a Dockerfile as junderw/bitcoinjs-regtest-server on Docker Hub.

    For that download the image from docker hub automatically:
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 junderw/bitcoinjs-regtest-server
```

2. Clone or download and run 
```
npm install
```

3. Run the accompanying client software https://gitlab.com/circle3/care-by-circle   or      run the testClient.js on our regtest server:

adapt constants.js to

```
module.exports = Object.freeze({
    VERSION: '0.13',
    SATOSHI_FOR_GENESIS: 1e6,
    ENTRY_COST_FACTOR: 0.5, // To let someone in your Circle costs you ENTRY_COST_FACTOR'th of your tokens
    DUST_SATOSHIS: 547, //547  =  1 more than dust https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/76157/45311

    LOCK_MAX_PENDING: 1000, // max number of users waiting on a lock, todo: DDOS danger!!
    LOCK_TIMEOUT: 10000,       

    // For testClient:
    BASE_URL: 'http://localhost:3000/api/',
    REGTEST_URL: 'http://localhost:8080/1',
    // BASE_URL: 'https://www.carebycircle.com/api/',
    // REGTEST_URL: 'https://www.carebycircle.com/1',
});
```
Then you need to set up a local mongodb, for this in clienTest.js to work:
```
MongoClient.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017", { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true }, function (err, database) {
    if (err) throw err;

    db = database.db("carebycircles");
    CirclesClientCollection = db.collection("clientData");

    // Start the application after the database connection is ready
    run();
});
```

Of course you can use any other database, like sqllite, or table for client side storage. 

Then:

```
node clientTest   #or use your favorite debugger
```

Adapt clientTest.js to your heart's desire. You are Done.

If you want to run locally:

4. Install and run mongodb locally, see for instructions: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/

5. Run a regtest server, e.g.:

```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 junderw/bitcoinjs-regtest-server
```

For your information: you can go into the docker by:

- get the CONTAINER_ID by

```
docker container ls
```
- then

```
docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash
```

- and then inside the docker you can execute commands like:

```
bitcoin-cli -regtest help
```

6.  Run the Oracle server 

```
cd oracleServer
node oracle.js    #or use your favorite debugger
```

7. Run a client or a test e.g.:

adapt constants.js see point 3.

```
node clientTest   #or use your favorite debugger
```

8. Be aware that if you often switch between local and remote regtest, then you should empty the client side database (see point 3).

## Ideas ##

- A transaction may contain binary metadata: should we allow owners of the asset add some additonal binary data to the as the "asset history" (like adding engravings to the owned token)
- A Circle can elect a specialist among itsself, who can go in a new Circle S with specialists from other Circles. Circle S can elect a superspecialist that form with other superspecilists a new Cicrle S2 etc. This will lead to a log(N) working direct democracy?

## A demo of a testclient ##
1. Alice generates a Circle & gets airdropped some tokens
2. Alice adds Bob to her Circle
3. Alice adds Charlie to her Circle
4. Alice tries to add somebody with an invalid contract -> should fail
5. Alice tries to add Charlie once again -> should fail
6. Alice tries to add more than 150 friends to her Circle (should fail at the 151th, takes a couple of minutes on regtest)
